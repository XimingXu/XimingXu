## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m Ximing, a recent M.Sc. graduate in Astrophysics from University College London (UCL) and an aspiring astrophysics researcher with a strong interest in exoplanet research.

ðŸ”¬ My research interests include:
- Discovering, characterizing, and analyzing the demographics of exoplanets using techniques such as transit and microlensing.
- Studying the atmospheric composition and potential biosignatures of exoplanets ranging from hot Jupiters to terrestrial planets using transit spectroscopy.

ðŸ“‚ Selected projects:
- [Transit Fitting and Stellar Modeling (M.Sc. Thesis)](https://github.com/XimingXu/msc-thesis-transit-fitting-stellar-parameters): Python pipeline for fitting TESS light curves and modeling transiting exoplanet host stars to better constrain their properties.
